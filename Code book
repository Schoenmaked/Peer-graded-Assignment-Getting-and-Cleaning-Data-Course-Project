Measurements
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then 
sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, 
which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration 
and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff 
frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean() - The mean value.
std() - The standard deviation.

In the tidydataset are  66 variables.Each value represents the average value of each variable for each activity and
each subject.
